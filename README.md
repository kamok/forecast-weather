# Enter Zipcode, get current temperature
This repository uses the Forecast.io weather API to get the temperature data. 

Using google maps geocode api, I'm able to convery zipcodes into geo coordinates (latitude, longitude), which is required for the Forecast.io API. 

# Future plans 
Incorporate this into the navbar of my rails website. Gets the geocordinates from the visitor's I.P. and display current temp, as well as the weather icons.
